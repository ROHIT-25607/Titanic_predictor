# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features like age, gender, class, fare, and embarkation port.

Built using Python and Scikit-learn, it includes a Logistic Regression model and a simple evaluation pipeline with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset for binary classification and is loaded from a public GitHub URL for quick access and testing.
